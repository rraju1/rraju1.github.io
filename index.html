<p>Hello, welcome to my home page! </p>

<p> I currently work at SambaNova Systems as a software engineer looking at improving large language models (LLMs). Currently, I am researching alignment methods to make language models comply with enterprise user preferences, which include techniques like RLHF, preference model pretraining (PMP), RLAIF, etc. Another aspect that I am working on is the viability of using State Space Models (SSMs) as an alternative to attention-based transformer models for language tasks on the SambaNova Systems software stack. I am especially interested making models more effiencent via sparsity either by reducing computational burden during training or inference with structured sparsity. </p>
<p>I did my PhD from UW-Madison with Mikko Lipasti. You can click the About Me tab to learn more about my background or visit my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-raju-ab124676/).</p>
<p>My goal for this upcoming year in 2024 is to create a set of blog posts summarizing papers and explore interesting ideas in NLP, as well as start to be more involved in the open-source community.  Currently, my website/blogs are still under construction but there should be more interesting content coming up soon!</p>
